# Grocery Store Price Comparator

## Project Overview
This project is a JavaFX application designed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The application serves as a grocery store price comparator, allowing users to add grocery stores, list products with their prices, and compare these prices across different stores to find the best deals. The development of this application demonstrates my proficiency in Java and JavaFX, as well as my ability to apply advanced OOP concepts in a real-world scenario.
